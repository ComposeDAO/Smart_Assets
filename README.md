# Smart_Assets
A repo with documentation and reference code for smart assets using purses. The concept originated with a course taught at [Chapman University -- Introduction to Smart Contracts](https://github.com/alexhkurz/introduction-to-smart-contracts). Documenting the concept and providing reference code in various smart contract languages will be provided in this repository. Please feel free to fork and contribute with your own Pull Requests.

This project has been moved to [GitLab: https://gitlab.com/smart-assets.io/](https://gitlab.com/smart-assets.io/)



## Conceptualized as Containers
This diagram relates the overall concept. The repository is focused on providing frameworks across various Blockchains, including Bitcoin, to provide a Purse and Smart Wallet capability. It relies on using smart contract langauges which use channel encapsulation as well as linear channels. More to come soon.
